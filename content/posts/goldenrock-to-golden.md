        Moving from Golden Rock in India to Golden, Colorado, has been a journey filled with cultural contrasts...

    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em; color: #E0E0E0;">
        Back home in India, tap water is something you wouldn't dream of drinking without boiling or filtering first. But here in the US, everyone drinks straight from the tap! At first, I hesitated and stared at the glass, wondering if this was a good idea. But soon, I got used to it, and now, I love the convenience (though I still miss our boiled water).

    <h2 style="color: #4CAF50; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;">The Mysterious Toilet Seat Cover</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em; color: #E0E0E0;">
        In India, we flush and typically use a handheld hose (or bidet) to clean up—it's quick and thorough. But here in the US, I was introduced to a completely different approach: toilet paper, wipes, and the mysterious toilet seat covers. At first, it was a bit of a puzzle to figure out how to use these covers, but once you get the hang of it, it’s a pretty neat way to keep things clean. If you’re as confused as I was, check out this video on how to set one up:

        Also, public restrooms are super clean here, which I absolutely love. It's something I strive to maintain wherever I go.

    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em; color: #E0E0E0;">
        One of the biggest shocks was at the cash register—why is the price higher than what’s on the tag? Welcome to the world of taxes that aren’t included in the price, and don’t forget to tip! It took a while to get used to tipping 15-20% on everything, but it’s just part of the culture here.

    <h2 style="color: #4CAF50; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;">Honking: It’s Not What You Think</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em; color: #E0E0E0;">
        In India, honking is like saying, "Hey, I'm here!" In the US, honking is more like, "What are you doing?!" It’s less about signaling and more about expressing displeasure, which I quickly learned to avoid.

    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em; color: #E0E0E0;">
        As someone who hits the gym regularly, I quickly realized that everything here is in pounds (lbs), not kilograms. To make life easier, I created an app that helps with these conversions—check it out if you’re in the same boat:

        Oh, and don't be surprised if people walk around naked in the locker rooms. It's totally normal here. Just smile and carry on.

    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em; color: #E0E0E0;">
        Drinking is a pretty normal and socially accepted activity here. Whether it’s a casual drink after work or a weekend hangout, alcohol is a common sight.

    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em; color: #E0E0E0;">
        One of the most charming aspects of American culture is the way people hold doors open for others. It’s such a small gesture, but it really makes your day. I’ve started doing it myself, and it’s a habit I’m happy to pick up.

        Navigating these cultural differences has been both amusing and enlightening. Moving to a new country comes with its challenges, but it’s these little quirks that make the journey worthwhile. If you’re an international student or just curious about these cultural contrasts, I hope you enjoyed this peek into my experience!
