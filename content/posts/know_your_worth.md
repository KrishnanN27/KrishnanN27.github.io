    <img src="/images/india/i18.jpeg" alt="Know Your Worth" style="width: 250px; height: auto; border-radius: 10px; margin-right: 20px; box-shadow: 0 6px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">

        <p>
            I recently came across an analogy that resonated deeply with me, so I wanted to share it. The analogy shows how the same object (or person) can be valued differently depending on the surroundings.
        </p>
           <p>
            Here's the story:  
            A bottle of water at Costco costs $0.25.  
            The same bottle in a supermarket is worth about $0.50.  
            At a bar, the same bottle costs $2.  
            In a high-end restaurant or hotel, the bottle might be priced as high as $3.  
            At an airport or on a plane, the bottle is sold for $5.  
            The bottle and its contents don’t change—the only thing that varies is where it is being sold. Each environment assigns a different value to the same product.
        </p>
        <p>
            This analogy reminds us that when you feel underappreciated, it’s often not because of who you are, but because of where you are.

## The Courage to Change Places

<div style="padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05); color: var(--primary-color);">
When the environment you're in doesn't recognize your worth, it’s important to have the courage to change. Like the bottle, your value remains the same, but it's how others perceive and treat you that changes depending on the environment.  
Surround yourself with people and places that appreciate your true worth and potential. Don’t settle for less than what you deserve.

    <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 0.9em;">
        <strong>Takeaway:</strong> You are valuable as you are, but not every place will see that. Find the environment that values you, and never settle for less.
