<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; margin: 20px 0;">
    <img src="/images/india/i18.jpeg" alt="Know Your Worth" style="width: 250px; height: auto; border-radius: 10px; margin-right: 20px; box-shadow: 0 6px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">

        <p>
            I recently came across an analogy that resonated deeply with me, so I wanted to share it. The analogy illustrates how the same object (or person) can be valued differently depending on the surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's the story:  
            - A bottle of water at Costco costs $0.25.  
            - The same bottle in a supermarket is worth about $0.50.  
            - At a bar, the same bottle costs $2.  
            - In a high-end restaurant or hotel, the bottle might be priced as high as $3.  
            - At an airport or on a plane, the bottle is sold for $5.  
            The bottle and its contents don’t change—the only thing that varies is where it is being sold. Each environment assigns a different value to the same product.
        </p>
        <p>
            This analogy reminds us that when you feel underappreciated, it’s often not because of who you are, but because of where you are.

## The Courage to Change Places

<div style="padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05); color: var(--primary-color);">
When the environment you're in doesn't recognize your worth or fail to provide the opportunities you need, it might be time to consider changing your surroundings. Just like a bottle of water, your value remains constant, but the environment's perception of that value can differ greatly. Sometimes, finding the right environment where your skills and contributions are appreciated can make all the difference in your personal and professional growth.
